# msfs-sdk-docs

Since this repository was created, Microsoft and Asobo have totally revamped and publically hosted the new Microsoft Flight Simulator documentation.

This completely removes the need for this repository and corresponding site hosted at Netlify.

This repository is now archived, and no longer needed.
